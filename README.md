## Description

This is a small ruby application to validate code number in credit card.

## How to use

Execute ruby script with one argument input. Example `./check.rb 4556737586899855`.

I write unit testing to validate code. Write `ruby credit_card_test.rb` in terminal.

## Troubleshooting

Write `chmod u+x check.rb` in your terminal if permission was denied when execute `check.rb`.
